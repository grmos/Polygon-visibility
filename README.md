# Polygon-visibility

## Overview
The Polygon Visibility project is a C++ code that allows users to interactively explore and visualize the visibility of a randomly generated polygon from different points. This program provides a graphical user interface where users can control the display of visibility polygons and the non-empty core of the polygon.

## Functionality
1. Press the mouse at different spots to visualize the visibility polygons.
2. Press the "2" key to display the non-empty core of the polygon.
3. Press the "3" key to generate a new random polygon.
